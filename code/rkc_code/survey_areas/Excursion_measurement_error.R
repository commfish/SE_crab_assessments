# R script contains code to process data from Ocean AK to use in crab CSA models, code to run CSA model, and calls to create 
#     output and figures for annual stock health report.

# Read me:
#     update code with date updated (top), change global year, and pull new survey data (see below)

## load -------------------------

## setup global ---------------
