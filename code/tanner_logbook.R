# Code to review logbook data for Tanner crab fishery.
# needed to seperate out catch for Lynn Sisters and North Juneau, previously done in .JMP and Excel

# logbook data from ALEX (as of 10-16-18) pull only data from district 115 - have to sort here for sub-district 10
#    since that's all that is needed. Pull for all years and save file in results/tanner
